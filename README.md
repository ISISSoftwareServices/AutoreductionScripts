# AutoreductionScripts
A repository that houses the workflow scripts used at ISIS for different instruments.

These scripts are maintained a freely accessible to instrument scientists and user via the autoreduction directory in the ISIS data cache `NDX<inst>\user\scripts\autoreduction` This repository is simply required in order to track the versions of these scripts used at any given time period. 

The scripts held in the repository are going to be updated daily by cron job to start with. In the future, we will look to instead update these with each run for improved accuracy.
